This project contains two directories. One is for the server-side implementation, and one is for the client-side. The synchronization is done manually by generating a prefab on the server side (select Transfer->PreparePrefab) and by importing the relevant asset into the client side with a 
unity asset package.

You need to have Blender installed to get the project loaded.

You will need to replace the scene with the sample scene in assets.

When opening the oculus project answer the question for the input system with no and switch the build platform to Android.
